EHealth-Care
. Front-end devoloped using react

. Back-end should be devoloped by using Node.JS, MangoDB,
. The Front-end repo code is here https://github.com/parmarraj999/ehealth-care

### Backend Setup:

1. **Node.js and npm:**
    - **Download:** Visit the official Node.js website and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.
    - **Install:** Follow the installer's instructions.
    - **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js. Use it to manage dependencies.
2. **Express.js:**
    - **Installation:** Open your terminal and run:
        
        Bash
        
        `npm install express`
        
        Use code [with caution.](https://www.notion.so/faq#coding)
        
3. **MongoDB:**
    - **Cloud Database:** Consider using a free tier of a cloud database provider like MongoDB Atlas. This allows you to manage your database without setting up a local server.
    - **Local Setup:** If you prefer local setup, you can install MongoDB Community Server. However, be aware of potential maintenance and security considerations.

### Backend Development:

1. **Project Structure:**
    - Create a basic project structure:
        
        `your-project/
        ├── server.js
        ├── routes/
        │   ├── api.js
        │   ├── admin.js
        │   └── user.js
        ├── models/
        │   ├── hospital.js
        │   ├── doctor.js
        │   └── user.js
        ├── config/
        │   └── database.js`
        
2. **Database Models:**
    - Define schemas for hospitals, doctors, users, and appointments using Mongoose:
        
        JavaScript
        
        `// models/hospital.js
        const mongoose = require('mongoose');
        
        const hospitalSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            name: String,
            address: String,
            // ... other fields
        });
        
        module.exports = mongoose.model('Hospital', hospitalSchema);`
        
        Use code [with caution.](https://www.notion.so/faq#coding)
        
3. **API Routes:**
    - **User Routes:**
        - User registration and login
        - Book appointments
        - Search for doctors
        - Send medicine requests
    - **Admin Routes:**
        - Add and manage hospitals and doctors
        - View and respond to medicine requests
4. **Backend Logic:**
    - Implement server-side logic for:
        - User authentication and authorization
        - Database operations (CRUD)
        - Email or SMS notifications for appointments and medicine requests

### Deployment:

1. **Heroku:** A popular platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider. It offers a free tier for small applications.
2. **Vercel:** Another great option for deploying Node.js applications. It also has a free tier.
